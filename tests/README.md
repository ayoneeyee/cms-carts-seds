### Other Notes/Bugs

- 13 November 2020: Bug Impact (Low) There is a (possible) bug in chromedriver, when running tests headless(without a browser).
Description: When attempting to perform an action on a clickable element, chromedriver reports an error, 
falsely identifying the element as a non-clickable element`[size of the element is zero]`. Until this is resolved,
avoid running headless tests in chromedriver.
